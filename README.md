# Rudolphian Market
A simple 2D game consisting of pixel sprites, dummy animations and carnival music. Your task is to collect shining objects in which the Emperor Rudolph II might be interested and dodge everything else. While progressing the game, enemies are getting faster, spawn in batches (fortunately, there is a blue gem that reduces the enemy count) and also new mob types emerge.
The entire project is a variation on Dodge the Creeps, a sample game meant as an introduction to game development with Godot Engine.
